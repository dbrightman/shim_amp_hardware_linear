# MGH open-source shim amplifier repo. 

This repo contains files related to the MGH "Revision D" linear amplifier development (and associated projects).  

Content will include design files and bills of materials for both the Printed Circuit Boards (power board, control board, and power distribution board) as well as the mechanical enclosure.

The software for controlling the shim amplifiers via a Snickerdoodle device will be located on a separate repo. TBD.
